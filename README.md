## Engineering Mathematics and Computing: Task 1

This task is being submitted via CANVAS in PDF format only. Here's what you can expect in each part of the coursework:

### Part A
- This part includes my worked solutions. I've chosen to submit scanned handwritten notes as they reflect my learning process.
  
### Part B
- This part is all about MATLAB code. I will be submitting well-commented code with relevant screenshots of the command window and graphs.
  - The key here is that **all graph formatting is done purely via MATLAB code**.
  - Additionally, the programs will be designed to ensure user-friendly input and neatly formatted output.

## Module Learning Outcomes
This task will help demonstrate my understanding and ability to:
1. **Manipulate algebraic functions** (including polynomials, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic) and work with complex numbers (e.g., powers and roots of complex numbers).
2. **Formulate and solve mathematical problems** involving differentiation, integration, matrices, vector analysis, geometry, trigonometry, and probability/statistical analysis using tools like MATLAB.

## Part A: LaTeX Compilation

Given my proficiency with **LaTeX**, I have chosen to compile my solutions using **LaTeX** and **TeXstudio**. This allows me to present clean, professional, and readable mathematical formulations, as itâ€™s a more organized way to express the complex calculations and concepts Iâ€™ll be working on.

## Part B: MATLAB Code

For Part B, the focus is on providing user-friendly and accessible MATLAB code that can handle complex mathematical problems. I plan to employ the following strategies for ensuring clarity and usability across a range of potential users:

### Approach 1: Enhancing User Experience through Clear and Visual Representation of Mathematical Solutions
Mathematical problems, particularly in topics like calculus, linear algebra, or statistics, are easier to understand when results are **clearly visualized**. To improve comprehension, I will:
- Use **graphical representations** of mathematical solutions, such as plotting derivatives, integrals, and matrix visualizations using MATLAB's `plot`, `surf`, and `quiver`.
- Incorporate **interactive graphical interfaces**, so users can adjust parameters like coefficients in a system of equations or visualize changes in vector fields in real time.
- Ensure **formatted output** of analytical results, using LaTeX-style expressions for a professional and easily readable result.
- Present **statistical data visually** in histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts to simplify data analysis and enhance user interaction.

The downside of this approach is that it might be difficult to balance with more detailed coding-based solutions for those who prefer working directly with code.

### Approach 2: Providing an Interactive Programming Environment
For users who prefer a more hands-on approach and want to directly engage with code, I'll offer:
- **Clear and accessible code snippets**, well-commented for easy customization and understanding.
- An **interactive command-line interface (CLI)** that guides users through running code, making it easier to follow instructions and understand each part of the process.
- **Jupyter Notebooks or similar tools** to allow for interactive code execution, visualizations, and immediate feedback.

## Conclusion

Both approaches (visual representation and interactive programming) are designed to cater to different user needs. I aim to make this assignment accessible and adaptable, offering solutions for both beginners and advanced users. For each problem, I'll provide multiple refined solutions, allowing users to pick the one that best suits their preferences and expertise.

I hope this approach reflects my understanding and dedication to completing this task thoroughly and professionally. If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of the coursework, feel free to reach out.

Good luck to everyone working on the task! ðŸš€
